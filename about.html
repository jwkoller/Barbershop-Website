				<h2>Where We Started</h2>
				<div class="about_text">
					<p>Jeri’s Old School Barbershop was founded in June 2017 by John and Jeri Zidlick with the idea that Barbershops of old had the right way of doing things: personal service, attention to detail, and quality.  Your look and style, whatever that may be, is what the world around us sees.  You should feel good about the way you look and shouldn’t entrust keeping up that look to anyone or anyplace that treats you as just another head of hair to cut and get out the door for the next person.  Barbers and their shops used to form strong relationships with their clients that would last for years. Jeri’s Old School Barbershop aims to bring that back.</p>
					<p>It is import to all of us at Jeri's that we develop and maintain strong bonds with the local community.  Keep checking back here for updates on charity events, food drives, and other community outreach that Jeri's is proud to be a part of. Visit our Contact Us page to submit a charity event you would like us to participate in.</p>
